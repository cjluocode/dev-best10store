Let me share my store with you.\r\n3 years ago, I start my first company which was an ios app. We failed. \r\nI was very disappointed and lost many money and time because of it. At that time, someone told me about lean startup method which uses the minimal time and effort to validate your idea. Wow, What a great method.\r\nI started to search for any way I could learn more about it. I found \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries. So I systematically learned lean startup method. I really appreciated. I failed my second and third with lean way. I didn't lose much and learned a lot because I applied what I have learned from books.\r\nThat's why I love reading now. By the way, I am really tired of searching a right book on Amazon and Google. Luckily, I found a great website: https://best10.tips. The web will return best 10 books based on customer satisfaction and rating. You can find a great book faster with it.", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/customer.jpg"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "How to make $5000 per month online as a part-time job", "content": "<div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-8 offset-2\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <h3 class=\"text-center font-weight-bold\">How I make $5000 per month online as a part-time job</h3>\r\n    <br>\r\n       <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/make_money.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">Everyone loves money.

Don't put ads on your blog</b> <br></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/bloger_3.jpg\" height=\"330\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n            <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">I know many bloggers make money by putting Google ads on their sites. Don't do it. Putting too many ads only can distract user's experience. Don't care about small money. You need more audience first then some companies will find and sponsor you. You need to get people's attention first. Be patient. That's how you make big money not ads.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">Okay,you know the 3 tips now.
