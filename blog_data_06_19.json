Let me share my store with you.\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n    3 years ago, I start my first company which was an ios app which was \"Uber for Food\".In the beginning, we were so excited to create next Billion level company. After spending 7 months development on the project, we still didn't even have a real product. Meanwhile, we were just adding more and more features we thought customers would love. Finally, we got the first version of the app after 9 months of development. As you think, when we deliver this app to real users. None of them even need it, let alone love all features we built. Therefore, we FAILED.\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">\r\n   I was very disappointed and lost many money and time because of it.\r\nAt that point, I felt hopeless because I tried to my best but still failed.\r\nWhat should I do next? Am I really fit for entrepreneurship?\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">\r\nLuckily, my friend told me about lean startup method. Uses the minimal time and effort to validate your idea. When the idea is validated, you can double down. So you don't have to waste money and resources to build a product nobody wants.\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n  <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51T-sMqSMiL._AC_US218_.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">\r\nWow, What a great method. It totally blows my mind.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">\r\n    I started to search for any way I could learn more about it. I found <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1529444561&sr=8-2&keywords=the+lean+startup\" target=\"_blank\">\"The Lean Startup\"</a> by Eric Ries. So I systematically learned lean startup method. I really appreciated.\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        I tried my second startup which was a VR dating app in a month. We spent 2 less than two weeks to build the MVP(minimum viable product). Then we brought it to users. People did not like it. Yes. It didn't work out but I didn't lose a lot either. Plus, I have learned a lot of experience about the lean product development as well. I was happy about it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        It's really to see how I changed myself by reading startup books.\r\nThat's why I love reading now. If you want, you can do it too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p class=\"lead text-muted\">Updated a month ago</p>\r\n<br><br><br><br><br>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/customer.jpg"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "How to Make $5000 Per Month Online as a Part-Time Job", "content": "<div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-8 offset-2\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    <br><br>\r\n    <h3 class=\"text-center font-weight-bold\">How I make $5000 per month online as a part-time job</h3>\r\n    <br>\r\n       <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/make_money.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">Everyone loves money. I always seek a better way to make more money with less time. 2 years ago, my friend made $100,000 as a blogger. It blew my mind because I never thought that making money online is real. Since last year, I started learning how to make money online as a blogger and made some money. So I would share some experience with you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\"><b>1. Find your interests</b> <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    Everyone is different and unique so find what your interests and write about it. I love reading books and learning new things, so my blog mainly about learning and books. What's your passion?</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\"><b>2. Find your role model and learn from them</b> <br></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LxIlKMpqL._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" height=\"250\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n<p class=\"content-text\">I have been reading books and studying successful cases since last year.\r\n    Everyone makes mistakes but you don't make same mistakes.\r\n    So read books and blogs from your role model.\r\n    I highly recommend \"How To Make Money Blogging:\r\n    How I Replaced My Day Job With My Blog\".

Don't do it. Putting too many ads only can distract user's experience. Don't care about small money. You need more audience first then some companies will find and sponsor you. You need to get people's attention first. Be patient. That's how you make big money not ads.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">Okay,you know the 3 tips now.

I wanna share an idea of Dapp(Decentralized App) with you guys. In the past couple of years, I have been practicing a foreign language with my language partner via Skype.\r\n        <b>But I found two major pain points of language exchange.</b>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n      If you are new to Blockchain, I would recommend you to read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Basics-Non-Technical-Introduction-Steps/dp/1484226038/ref=sr_1_4/144-0593556-3703730?ie=UTF8&qid=1529254746&sr=8-4&keywords=blockchain\" target=\"_blank\">\"Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps\"\r\n        </a>.  If you are not a tech person, read it. This book is simple and easy to understand.Enjoy it.\r\n    </p>\r\n        <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hznz78ZHL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"300\"></p>\r\n\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n       First, language learners don't have long-term motivation. After first couple months, most of them will lose interest because learning a language is really hard.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n        <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n            Second, the process of language exchanging is efficient. There is no systematic syllabus for language learners. Sometimes, I don't know how to teach him even though it is my native language.\r\n        </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/bitcoin.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n      So I think Dapp might solve these problems.This is my idea.\r\nFirst, we can develop a new token when this web launches. All language learners spend 20 coins for each lesson they book,\r\n        earn 20 coins for each lesson they host. The more you teach, the more coins you gain. This is coins can exchange to the token.\r\n        So we can have a money-driven for all learners.This coin system can make sure everyone is contributing to the platform.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        Second, we can contribute language learning material. Learners can upvote the great content, downvote bad ones.\r\n        The more upvote you gain, the more token you gain. These coin rewards can motivate users post and generate more and more great educational material.\r\n\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        It's my little thoughts. Please let me know what you think.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"lead text-muted\">Update 3 weeks ago</p>\r\n    <br><br><br><br><br>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/blockchain.jpg"}}, {"model": "blogs.blog", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "How Did I Become a  Entrepreneur Who Can Code", "content": "<br>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-8 offset-2\">\r\n    <h2 class=\"title-text text-center\">How Did I Become a  Entrepreneur Who Can Code</h2>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/Webp.net-resizeimage+(1).jpg\"  height=\"300\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        Hi, guys. The reason I wanna share my entrepreneurial journey is that everyone should believe in yourself and your dreams. A little bit about me,\r\nI started my 1st startup which was 'Uber for food' app 3 years ago. We failed.2nd one was AR dating app. It didn't work out either. After 2 years and 2 big failures, my two technical co-founders decided to leave the team. I totally understand how hard running a startup is and everyone needs income to pay bills. So I throw a farewell party for them. We shut the second company down.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        I majored music composing in college and know nothing about coding. There were two ways for me to go if I would like to:  I could find another technical co-founder or I train myself to a coder.It was very tough time for me. However, I know I am a freaking hustler. I believe I can achieve anything I want.  I chose to learn to code by myself. After a week research about how to learn code effectively. I made a learning plan.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        This is my learning path: 09/2017, I started to learn Python. All basic knowledge of Python. There are many great tutorial videos on youtube.If you want to read books. I recommend starting with\r\n        <a href=\"\">\"A Smarter Way to Learn Python: Learn it faster. Remember it longer.\"</a>\r\n        \"The reason I picked it was that Python is very popular and easy-understand.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class=\"text-center\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fNZfTUPXL.jpg\"  height=\"300\"  alt=\"\"></p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n    10/2017, I started to learn Django. For me, I don't wanna be an engineer. My goal is to be an entrepreneur who can make MVP. So choosing a framework definitely can speed up your process of building MVP. I found many great tutorials on Udemy and Youtube.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        11/2017, I launched my first self-made web which is language learning platform. I learned to push a web to production mode, bugs monitoring, ASW S3, Heroku etc.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        Lucky me, the web got 3000/monthly active users at 12/2017. People liked it. I didn't stop there, I learned algorithms in Python 01/2018 because I know if I want my code to be more efficient, I need the knowledge. 02/2018, started learning Javascript and Jquery which can make the better user experience.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        After gathering 3 months data of the web, I started to seek external investors and funding. I got the traction. However, there was a crucial problem in the business model. It's hard to make money unless we put annoying ads on the web. All services on the web are 100% free. So I was trying to pivot a better way. After couple months of pivoting, I know it is time to let it go.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        YES. I failed again. But this time, I made the MVP by myself.\r\nI got traction with $0 expense on marketing. Language learners liked it. I made it. Now, I am an entrepreneur and coder. This is my journey. You can make it if you want.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"content-text\">\r\n        Recently, I am planning to start my next company, a comparison shopping engine. For example, you want to buy a book about the startup, you search in this web, it will give you top 10 list of books on startup based on customers\r\nfeedback, satisfaction, reviews, price etc.\r\nIn order to make this product, I am learning web crawler, sort algorithms, and some deep learning.\r\nHappy coding & learning.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    <p class=\"lead text-muted\">Updated 2 weeks
