Let me share my store with you.\r\n3 years ago, I start my first company which was an ios app. We failed. \r\nI was very disappointed and lost many money and time because of it. At that time, someone told me about lean startup method which uses the minimal time and effort to validate your idea. Wow, What a great method.\r\nI started to search for any way I could learn more about it. I found \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries. So I systematically learned lean startup method. I really appreciated. I failed my second and third with lean way. I didn't lose much and learned a lot because I applied what I have learned from books.\r\nThat's why I love reading now. By the way, I am really tired of searching a right book on Amazon and Google. Luckily, I found a great website: https://best10.tips. The web will return best 10 books based on customer satisfaction and rating.

Find your interests\r\nEveryone is different and unique so find what your interests and write about it. I love traveling, my blogs mainly about traveling.\r\n\r\n2. Find your role model and learn from them\r\nI have been reading books and studying successful cases since last year. Everyone makes mistakes but you don't make same mistakes.

Don't put ads on your blog\r\nI know many bloggers make money by putting Google ads on their sites. Don't do it. You need more audience first then some companies will find to sponsor you. That's how you make big money not ads.\r\n\r\nGood Luck. \r\n\r\nThe lean startup"}}]
