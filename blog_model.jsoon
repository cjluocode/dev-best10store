Let me share my store with you.\r\n3 years ago, I start my first company which was an ios app. We failed. \r\nI was very disappointed and lost many money and time because of it. At that time, someone told me about lean startup method which uses the minimal time and effort to validate your idea. Wow, What a great method.\r\nI started to search for any way I could learn more about it. I found \"The Lean Startup\" by Eric Ries. So I systematically learned lean startup method. I really appreciated. I failed my second and third with lean way. I didn't lose much and learned a lot because I applied what I have learned from books.\r\nThat's why I love reading now. By the way, I am really tired of searching a right book on Amazon and Google. Luckily, I found a great website: https://best10.tips.
