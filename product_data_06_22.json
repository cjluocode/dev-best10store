But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched. \r\n\r\nEric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on \"validated learning,\" rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.\r\n\r\nRather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.", "category": "Business"}}, {"model": "featured_products.product", "pk": 572, "fields": {"title": "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future", "link": "https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_21/132-1229690-8670951?ie=UTF8&qid=1529693950&sr=8-21&keywords=startup", "rating": 4.5, "rating_count": 1891, "hotscore": 90, "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4137OkbPQ4L._AC_US218_.jpg", "price": 1, "comment_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Zero+to+One%3A+Notes+on+Startups%2C+or+How+to+Build+the+Future", "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to build a better future, you must believe in secrets.\r\n\r\nThe great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. \r\n\r\nThiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we\u2019re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.\r\n\r\nDoing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won\u2019t make a search engine. Tomorrow\u2019s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today\u2019s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. \r\n\r\nZero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.", "category": "Business"}}, {"model": "featured_products.product", "pk": 573, "fields": {"title": "The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-By-Step Guide for Building a Great Company", "link": "https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-Step/dp/0984999302/ref=sr_1_13/132-1229690-8670951?ie=UTF8&qid=1529693950&sr=8-13&keywords=startup", "rating": 4.5, "rating_count": 295, "hotscore": 90, "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L7EwwlkbL._AC_US218_.jpg", "price": 1, "comment_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The+Startup+Owner%27s+Manual%3A+The+Step-By-Step+Guide+for+Building+a+Great+Company", "description": "The Startup Owner's Manual is a step-by-step, near-encyclopedic reference manual or \"how to\" for building a successful, scalable startup. \r\nWant to know what to do the first, week, month or year?\r\nWhat's the right distribution channel for your product?\r\nHow to get traffic to your web site? \r\n\u2026and how to activate customers or users on arrival?\r\nWho are the right \"first customers,\" and why?\r\n\u2026plus many more great tips in nearly 500 pages, complete with index,\r\nglossary, and Customer Development Checklists\r\n\r\nIt's the indispensible reference guide for any startup founder, entrepreneur, investor or educator.", "category": "Business"}}, {"model": "featured_products.product", "pk": 574, "fields": {"title": "The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future", "link": "https://www.amazon.com/100-Startup-Reinvent-Living-Create/dp/0307951529/ref=sr_1_9/132-1229690-8670951?ie=UTF8&qid=1529693950&sr=8-9&keywords=startup", "rating": 4.4, "rating_count": 1369, "hotscore": 88, "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MKq40o71L._AC_US218_.jpg", "price": 1, "comment_url": "https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=The+%24100+Startup%3A+Reinvent+the+Way+You+Make+a+Living%2C+Do+What+You+Love%2C+and+Create+a+New+Future", "description": "In The $100 Startup, Chris Guillebeau shows you how to lead of life of adventure, meaning and purpose \u2013 and earn a good living.\r\n \r\nStill in his early thirties, Chris is on the verge of completing a tour of every country on earth \u2013 he\u2019s already visited more than 175 nations \u2013 and yet he\u2019s never held a \u201creal job\u201d or earned a regular paycheck.
