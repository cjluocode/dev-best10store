    <p class="content-text">I know many bloggers make money by putting Google ads on their sites. Don't do it. Putting too many ads only can distract user's experience. Don't care about small money. You need more audience first then some companies will find and sponsor you. You need to get people's attention first. Be patient. That's how you make big money not ads.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="content-text">Okay,you know the 3 tips now. Good luck.</p>
