    <br>
<p class="lead text-justify">I am a college student. I always seek a better way to make more money with less time.2 years ago, my friend made $100,000 as a blogger. It blew my mind because I never thought that making money online is real. Since last year, I started learning how to make money online as a blogger and made some money. So I would share some experience with you.</p>
   <p class="text-center"> <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/a1-language/media/image/make_money.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p class="lead text-justify">1. Find your interests <br>
Everyone is different and unique so find what your interests and write about it. I love traveling, my blogs mainly about traveling.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">2. Find your role model and learn from them <br>
I have been reading books and studying successful cases since last year. Everyone makes mistakes but you don't make same mistakes. So read books and blogs from your role model. I highly recommend  "Make Money Blogging: Your clear path to $10,000 per month and beyond". If you want more book list. You can check https://best10.tips/. The website return best 10 items on whatever you search based on customers satisfaction. I found many great books via it.</p>

<p class="lead text-justify">3. Don't put ads on your blog <br>
I know many bloggers make money by putting Google ads on their sites. Don't do it. You need more audience first then some companies will find to sponsor you. That's how you make big money not ads.</p>

Good Luck.
